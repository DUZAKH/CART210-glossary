As an overall term, embodiment deals with physical repersentations of other subjects both real and abstract. However, depending on context the definition shifts.  In the contetx of computation and media, embodiment is a discourse that can center around avatars [^kleyjer01wiki], human interaction with the computer [^chen02wiki], immersion [dyson03wiki], cyborgs [haddow04wiki] and more.
