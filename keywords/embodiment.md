## Embodiment 

As an overall term, embodiment deals with physical representations of other subjects both real and abstract. For example, "She is the embodiment of anger!", this is simple enough to understand. 

However, depending on context the definition of the term shifts.  In computation and media, embodiment is a discourse that can be deeply philosophical and has a rich history. Within the body itself, the early 4EA (Embodied, Embedded, Extended, Enacted, Affective) cognitive science movement questioned the notion of computation related to an organism. Today, there remains three schools of thought to consider: body conservationism, body functionalism and body enactivism. The latter of which states that cognition arises from the dynamic interaction between an organism, its body, and its environment [^kiverstein05wiki].

Regarding the social aspect of media use, avatars are an emphatical part of online and offline embodiment as well as personas [^kleyjer01wiki].  Other things to consider are human interaction with the computer [^chen02wiki], immersion [^dyson03wiki], cyborgs [^haddow04wiki] and more.
